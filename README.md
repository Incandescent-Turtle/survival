# survival
an unfished game i started


top down game. building, food, hunger, resource collection, lore, inventory, enemies with pathfinding, doors, crafting, animations....a lot of stuff but it isnt a playable game
(well like it <i>is</i> playable, there is just no actual <i>game<i> to play. mechanics are there to play around with tho
